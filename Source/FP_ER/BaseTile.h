	* The functions of interest to initialization order for an Actor is roughly as follows:
	* PostLoad/PostActorCreated - Do any setup of the actor required for construction. PostLoad for serialized actors, PostActorCreated for spawned.
	* AActor::OnConstruction - The construction of the actor, this is where Blueprint actors have their components created and blueprint variables are initialized
	* AActor::PreInitializeComponents - Called before InitializeComponent is called on the actor's components
	* UActorComponent::InitializeComponent - Each component in the actor's components array gets an initialize call (if bWantsInitializeComponent is true for that component)
	* AActor::PostInitializeComponents - Called after the actor's components have been initialized
	* AActor::BeginPlay - Called when the level is started
